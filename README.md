# Self_Assessment

## Self-Assessment

The final project required applying machine learning model that we learned in the modules over the weeks in one month that was broken down into 4 segment, 1 segment per week. We were group of 4. So, we decided to take on each responsibilites as best we can per week as project progressed. This gave us an opportunity to work and get a sense of the real world experience. I started with exploratory data analysis in the Tableau, that gave me a good idea of what the dataset was all about, what are the key component or feature that might be very iomportant while we run the machine learning model. I was also handling the responsibility of creating brach in Github and later in the week started creating brach for each week, that helped us being self responsible for merginig the files in the branches. Then, I took on a responsible of machine learning and ran logistic regression model on both test and train dataset and created a confusion matrix plot. In week three and four, I took on responsibility of presentation part and amalgamated the slides in the deck my colleague had built for previous segment and also updated the Readme file accordingly.

## Team Assessment

I was little dubious about the team collaboration as we all were working full time. But it turned out that we were very effective at collaboratively completing the project in time. The means of communications we had available were very helpful in communicating and keeping each other updated on our respective taks and responsibilites. We constantly chatted in the group Slack channel we created. We atleast met twice a week in group or sometimes one on one for hour or two outside of the regular class and all of us were present in the regualr class and office hours. This made us very well aware of our responsibilites and manage each others expectations. We used both Zoom and Google Meet, which I found very conviniet. For organization of out materials for each segment in Github, we created branch for each segments weekly. Because of this everynody can mearge their work in Github as completed rather than one person pulling the request. We as a team were very understanding, we just didn't adhere to out weekly responsibilites, we would constantly communicate with each other and help each other as needed. The biggest piece of advice I would give is have a very open communication and be clear about ones responsibilities and expactation. Also, I would suggest to research and select a dataset that is very much of the interest and is suitable for running machine learning models.

## Summary of Project

For the final project, we decided to work on US airline passenger satisfaction dataset from Kaggle. The machine learning model we ran as as follows:

1. Logistic Regression Model
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Support Vector Machine

These three model were run to understand customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction rate. We also did the four important feature selection with the cutoff rate of r>0.4 which had the strongest correlation to predict whether the customer is satisfied or dissatisfied which led us to our conclusion that customers give most attention to online boarding while rating the service of airline. We also found out that type of travel, class and inflight entertainment play an important role in customers experience while they fly. 

We have these feature are well documented in Readme file which also contains link to Tableua for exploratory data analysis, dashboards and deck for the presentation.
